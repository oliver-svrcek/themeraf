# Themeraf (Zsh theme)

This is my own Zsh theme.

It shows the username, hostname, last two directories in the working directory path, git branch name (color indicates git status), timestamp and last exit status.

## Installation

### Manual

Just `source` the `Themeraf.zsh` file in the `.zshrc` file.
